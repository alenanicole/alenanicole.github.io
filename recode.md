## Project description

Castle of Conquest is a text-based adventure game where a player traverses through a series of areas, fighting monsters along the way. The player must make their way through four levels before they face off against the final boss to protect their land and win the game. Your hero, guided by a fairy named Kipp, must find their way through the land of Elbrein to stop the corrupted king in his evil ways. Each of the different lands contain different enemy types, with a certain chance to drop loot! Pay close attention to the world and events, and there might be some hidden upgrades to find. This project was coded in Java.

## How to compile and run the program
Step 1: Install the Netbeans IDE.

Step 2: Download the .zip folder from the Github repository.

## UI Design

This program is very user interactive. The user will begin by naming their character and accepting their quest. Then, they must battle through four different lands, fighting against enemies specific to regions. While the battles and looting processes are handled by the program, the user is responsible for equipping items in their inventory and using strength and health potions to boost their character. The user must also navigate certain areas of the world, searching to find hidden upgrades.

## Additional Considerations

For this recreation and expansion, I pulled inspiration from the original project, which was completed by myself, Bryce Furrow, James Way, and Camryn Shuler.
