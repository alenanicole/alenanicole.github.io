## Project description

This project was created to tansfer a file between two computers on the same network using a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) based server and client model. It first creates a connection between a computer running the server program and another computer running the client program. Then, the client will choose which file to send to the server and, if the file exists, will deconstruct the file into packets of 1000 bytes to be sent to the server and reconstructed. This program will work for various file types inclding .jpg, .png, and .txt. This program was coded in C++.

## How to compile and run the program

How to compile (if applicable) and run the project.

```bash
cd ./project
python setup.py
```

If the programming language does not require compilation, the update the heading to be “How to run the program.” If your application is deployed on a remote service, including instructions on how to deploy it.

## UI Design

Almost every program requires user interaction, even command-line programs. Include in this section the tasks the user can complete and what the program does. You don't need to include how it works here; that information may go in the project description or in an additional section, depending on its significance.
