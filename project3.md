## Project description

Castle of Conquest is a text-based adventure game where a player traverses through a series of areas, fighting monsters along the way. The player must make their way through four levels before they face off against the final boss to protect their land and win the game. Your hero, guided by a fairy named Nova, must find their way through the land of Ukro to stop the corrupted king in his evil ways. This was a team project completed by Bryce Furrow, James Way, Camryn Shuler, and I. This project was coded in Java.

## How to compile and run the program


## UI Design

Almost every program requires user interaction, even command-line programs. Include in this section the tasks the user can complete and what the program does. You don't need to include how it works here; that information may go in the project description or in an additional section, depending on its significance.

## 3. Additional Considerations

This projects could not have been accomplished without the help of my group: Bryce Furrow, James Way, and Camryn Shuler.
